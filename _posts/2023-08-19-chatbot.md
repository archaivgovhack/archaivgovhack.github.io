description: "Chatbot to retrieve archive objects PoC"
date: 2023-08-20
by: 'Archaiv'
icon: 'cpu'
questions:
  - question: 'Problem'
    answer: 'Digital archives have traditionally required tagging so users can search accurately. How can we develop an easier way for archivists and the community to summarise their documents, and make it easier for their users to access what they want?'
    
  - question: 'Solution'
    answer: 'We are using a chatbot to allow searching for relevant documents using natural language. This product is called Archaiv. We will allow searching using natural language which will return both a natural language response and structured tags. A diverse and robust governance board will work with the community to reduce bias.'

  - question: 'Chatbot'
    answer: 'Our chatbot was built so users could easily search for digital objects that were important to them. Find the code to run our bot at https://github.com/archaivgovhack/archaivgovhack.github.io'
