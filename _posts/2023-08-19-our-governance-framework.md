Managing the biases in an AI and ensuring it is used in an ethical manner is very important. An oversight Governance Board will be established to ensure Archaivâ€™s biases are understood and managed. This includes identifying the biases and accounting for them by manually tagging items that fall outside the average of the collection and reviewing any identifications that have been flagged as incorrect. Archaiv will be regularly reviewed and improved through this process to increase the quality of the search results and reduce the risks, such as discrimination, from using AIs for this purpose. The members of this board will be diverse in terms of age, race and gender and particular experience applicable to the archives/ data sets or research projects that are using Archaiv. This board will include Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander representatives. This board will have strong expertise in data management, ethics and AI development.
